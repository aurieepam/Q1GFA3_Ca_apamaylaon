    <h1><b>WIKI</b></h1>
    <h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
    <p>The data set is about the speculated academic performance of junior Filipino high school students. 
        <br><br> In the data set, we are welcomed with, first, the individuals from different schools and the variables we surveyed from them. This includes the school the respondent is previously studying in, their grade level last school year, their average grade, and their study hours per day. The class is spread out to 17 different Filipino junior high schools with 64 total respondents in. It is  mainly focused in the scope of Davao Region. 
        <br><br>Onto the topic of the data’s experimental unit, it is classified as a population of different students from different schools in our speculated scope of circle.
        <br><br>In terms of why we had the final choice as this for the topic of our data, is mainly because, we, ourselves are students, and are curious to know how the different school systems are doing. We mainly wanted to know the current situations of other students outside of our own study place, leading us up to digitally survey some variables out of our scope.</p>
    <br><h2><b>Qualitative Variables</b></h2>
    <h3><b>School</b></h3>
    <div class="school">
        <div id="r1">
            <img src="table1.png" alt="table1">
        </div>
        <div id="r2">

        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ql">
        <p>The pie chart of the variable school shows the biggest slice as the most frequent response from our survey, which is Daniel R. Aguinaldo National High School, telling us that most of the students we surveyed study here, with a total number of 26. The six smallest slices are the schools with the least frequent responses, indicating that we had 1 each of respondents that study from Catalunan Pequeno National High School, Davao City National High School, Ma-a National High School, Mary Mediatrix Academy Incorporated, Philippine Women’s College of Davao, and Sto. Nino National High School.
            <br><br>In the bar graph, the one that stands out the most is the most frequent in our data set: the Daniel R. Aguinaldo National High School. We can also easily see the smallest five, as they are all in the same level, which are the least frequent in our data set: the Catalunan Pequeno National High School, Davao City National High School, Ma-a National High School, Mary Mediatrix Academy Incorporated, Philippine Women’s College of Davao, and Sto. Nino National High School.

    <br><h3><b>Grade Level</b></h3>
    <div class="glevel">
        <div id="r3">
            <img src="table2.png" alt="table2">
        </div>
        <div id="r4">
            <img src="rfreq2.png" alt="rfreq1">
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="q2">
        <p>The variable Grade level has a pie chart with the biggest slice being 8, with a value of 43, which tells us that most of the grade level of the students we surveyed are in 8th grade. The smallest slice, 10, with a value of 3, tells us that we surveyed from the 10th grade level the least.
        <br><br>The bar graph of this variable shows the same as the pie chart, however in rectangular forms, with 8 being the highest and 10 being the lowest. The highest tells us the most frequent and the lowest tells us the least frequent. The order of frequency, from highest to lowest, of what the grade levels of our student respondents are grade 8 (43), grade 9 (11), grade 7 (7), and then grade 10 (3).
